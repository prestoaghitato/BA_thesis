field-specific operationalisation:
  distinguish between interpersonal and intrapersonal rules

Graphic that encodes the four dimensions on Rohlfing et al (2018: 3), maybe x, y, size, greyscale. Where is our ideal method? Where are the established ones and where is frequent pattern mining?

timeline:
May 21st: new coding scheme done, contact Sascha and ask if he can do the algorithmic bit
May 28th: create null distribution and get significance stuff done
Jun 04th: analyse significant rules, question, discuss, etc them
Jun 11th: find a suitable visualisation, get all graphics done
Jun 18th: everything done content-wise, presentation for ECDA done
Jun 25th: buffer, finish written thesis, typographic stuff
Jul 02nd: buffer
Jul 04th: conference
