\section{Association Rules}
In the following, I will first lay out the type of association rule used by \citeasnoun{rohlfing18} and then explain how I modified this scheme to better fit the linguistic, interactional nature of the data. The basic sequence is structured as follows:
\begin{quote}
	\code{<(A [1,3]),(A,B [3,4]),(A,B,C [4,7]),(C [7,9])(A,B,C [9,13])>}
\end{quote}

In traditional sequential pattern mining, the basic data type---called a sequence---is an ordered set of (unordered) item sets. Here, every item set in the sequence has an additional annotation marking the start and end time points between which the item set is contained in the data.
