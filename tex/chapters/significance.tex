\chapter{Establishing a Notion of Significance}
\emph{chapter description goes here}

\section{Method}
create null distribution by shuffling relative positions of events, then test for significance using tests suited for skewed distribution

Tests to be used:
- some sort of significance test
- support(X->Y) = P(XUY) and confidence(X->Y) = P(Y|X), both associated with an \emph{arbitrary} cutoff threshold \cite[p.~21~ff.]{han12}

``[M]any patterns that are interesting by objective standards may represent common sense and, therefore, are actually uninteresting.'' \cite[p.~22]{han12}
\section{Results}
show and discuss significant rules
