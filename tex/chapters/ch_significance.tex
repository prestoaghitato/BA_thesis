\emph{chapter description goes here}

\section{Method}
The method used here is similar to the one used by \citet[\pnum{10~f.}]{abuzhaya17}. A null distribution is created, which then serves as a basis the real distribution can be tested against for statistical significance.

create null distribution by shuffling relative positions of events, then test for significance using tests suited for skewed distribution

Tests to be used:
- some sort of significance test
- support(X->Y) = P(XUY) and confidence(X->Y) = P(Y|X), both associated with an \emph{arbitrary} cutoff threshold \citep[\pnum{21~ff.}]{han12}

``[M]any patterns that are interesting by objective standards may represent common sense and, therefore, are actually uninteresting.'' \citep[\pnum{22}]{han12}
\section{Results}
show and discuss significant rules
