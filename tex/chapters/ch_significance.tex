\emph{chapter description goes here}

\section{Method}
create null distribution by shuffling relative positions of events, then test for significance using tests suited for skewed distribution

Tests to be used:
- some sort of significance test
- support(X->Y) = P(XUY) and confidence(X->Y) = P(Y|X), both associated with an \emph{arbitrary} cutoff threshold \citep[\pnum{21~ff.}]{han12}

``[M]any patterns that are interesting by objective standards may represent common sense and, therefore, are actually uninteresting.'' \citep[\pnum{22}]{han12}
\section{Results}
show and discuss significant rules
