	Abstract = {While most evolutionary scenarios for language see it as a communication system with consequences on the language-ready brain, there are major difficulties for such a view. First, language has a core combination of features---semanticity, discrete infinity, decoupling---that makes it unique among communication systems and that raise deep problems for the view that it evolved for communication. Second, extant models of communication systems---the code model of communication (see Millikan 2005) and the ostensive model of communication (see Scott-Phillips 2015) cannot account for language evolution. I propose an alternative view, according to which language first evolved as a cognitive tool, following Fodor's (1975, 2008) Language of Thought Hypothesis, and was then expiated (externalized) for communication. On this view, a language-ready brain is a brain profoundly reorganized in terms of connectivity, allowing the human conceptual system to emerge, triggering the emergence of syntax. Language as used in communication inherited its core combination of features from the Language of Thought.},

@article{benus_pragmatic_2011,
	Abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between the variability in the temporal alignment of turn initiations and the pragmatics of interpersonal communication. The data come from spontaneous, task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English. In addition to analyzing the temporal aspects of turn-taking behavior in general, we focus on the timing of turn-initial single word grounding responses such as mmhm, okay, or yeah, and conversational fillers such as um or uh. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of temporal and rhythmic alignment patterns, we propose that these patterns are linked to the achievement of pragmatic goals by interlocutors. More specifically, we examine the role of timing in establishing common ground, and test the hypothesis that the degree of accommodation to temporal and metrical characteristics of an interlocutor's speech is one aspect of turn-taking behavior that signals asymmetrical dominance relationships between interlocutors. Our results show that dominance relationships linked to floor- control, as well as mutual common ground, are pragmatically constructed in part through the accommodation patterns in timing of turn-initial single word utterances.},

@article{chan_designing_2008,
	Abstract = {This paper describes research exploring the use of haptics to support users collaborating remotely in a single-user shared application. Mediation of turn-taking during remote collaboration provides a context to explore haptic affordances for background communication as well as control negotiation in remote collaboration: existing turn-taking protocols are rudimentary, lacking many communication cues available in face-to-face collaboration. We therefore designed a custom turn-taking protocol that allows users to express different levels of urgency in their request for control from a collaborator; state of control and requests are communicated by touch, with the intent of offloading visual attention. To support it, we developed a set of haptic icons, tangible stimuli to which specific meanings have been assigned.
Because we required an icon set which could be utilized with specified, varying levels of intrusiveness in real attentionally challenged situations, we used a perceptually guided procedure that consisted of four steps: initial icon set design, perceptual refinement, validation of learnability and effectiveness under workload, and deployment in an application simulation. We found that our haptic icons could be learned to a high degree of accuracy in under 3min and remained identifiable even under significant cognitive workload. In an exploratory observational study comparing haptic, visual, and combined haptic and visual support for our protocol, participants overall preferred the combined multi-modal support, and in particular preferred the haptic support for control changes and the visual support for displaying state. In their control negotiation, users clearly utilized the option of requesting with graded urgency. The three major contributions in this paper are: (1) the introduction and first case study using a systematic process for refining and evaluating haptic icons for background communication in a primarily visual application; (2) the usability observed for a particular set of icons designed with that process; and (3) the introduction of an urgency-based turn-taking protocol and a comparison of haptic, visual and multi-modal support of our implementation of that protocol.},

	Abstract = {In human cooperation, the concurrent usage of multiple so- cial modalities such as speech, gesture, and gaze results in robust and efficient communicative acts. Such multimodal- ity in combination with reciprocal intentions supports fluent turn-taking. I hypothesize that human-robot turn-taking can be made more fluent through appropriate timing of mul- timodal actions. Managing timing includes understanding the impact that timing can have on interactions as well as having a control system that supports the manipulation of such timing. To this end, I propose to develop a compu- tational turn-taking model of the timing and information flow of reciprocal interactions. I also propose to develop an architecture based on the timed Petri net (TPN) for the gen- eration of coordinated multimodal behavior, inside of which the turn-taking model will regulate turn timing and action initiation and interruption in order to seize and yield con- trol. Through user studies in multiple domains, I intend to demonstrate the system's generality and evaluate the system on balance of control, fluency, and task effectiveness.},

	Abstract = {Turn-taking is fundamental to the way humans engage in information exchange, but robots currently lack the turn-taking skills required for natural communication. In order to bring effective turn-taking to robots, we must first understand the underlying processes in the context of what is possible to implement. We describe a data collection experiment with an interaction format inspired by ``Simon says,'' a turn-taking imitation game that engages the channels of gaze, speech, and motion. We analyze data from 23 human subjects interacting with a humanoid social robot and propose the principle of minimum necessary information (MNI) as a factor in determining the timing of the human response. We also describe the other observed phenomena of channel exclusion, efficiency, and adaptation. We discuss the implications of these principles and propose some ways to incorporate our findings into a computational model of turn-taking.},

	Abstract = {Turn-taking interactions with humans are multimodal and reciprocal in nature. In addition, the tim- ing of actions is of great importance, as it influences both social and task strategies. To enable the precise control and analysis of timed discrete events for a robot, we develop a system for mul- timodal collaboration based on a timed Petri net (TPN) representation. We also argue for action interruptions in reciprocal interaction and describe its implementation within our system. Using the system, our autonomously operating humanoid robot Simon collaborates with humans through both speech and physical action to solve the Towers of Hanoi, during which the human and the robot take turns manipulating objects in a shared physical workspace. We hypothesize that action interruptions have a positive impact on turn-taking and evaluate this in the Towers of Hanoi domain through two experimental methods. One is a between-groups user study with 16 participants. The other is a simulation experiment using 200 simulated users of varying speed, initiative, compliance, and cor- rectness. In these experiments, action interruptions are either present or absent in the system. Our collective results show that action interruptions lead to increased task efficiency through increased user initiative, improved interaction balance, and higher sense of fluency. In arriving at these re- sults, we demonstrate how these evaluation methods can be highly complementary in the analysis of interaction dynamics.},

@article{corps_early_2018,
	Abstract = {During conversation, there is often little gap between interlocutors' utterances. In two pairs of experiments, we manipulated the content predictability of yes/no questions to investigate whether listeners achieve such co- ordination by (i) preparing a response as early as possible or (ii) predicting the end of the speaker's turn. To assess these two mechanisms, we varied the participants' task: They either pressed a button when they thought the question was about to end (Experiments 1a and 2a), or verbally answered the questions with either yes or no (Experiments 1b and 2b). Predictability effects were present when participants had to prepare a verbal response, but not when they had to predict the turn-end. These findings suggest content prediction facilitates turn-taking because it allows listeners to prepare their own response early, rather than because it helps them predict when the speaker will reach the end of their turn.},

	Abstract = {Virtual human, with realistic behaviors and social skills, evoke in users a range of social behaviors normally only seen in human face-to-face interactions. One of the key challenges in creating such virtual humans is to give them human-like conversational skills, such as turn-taking skill. In this paper, we propose a multimodal end-of-turn prediction model. Instead of recording face-to-face conversation data, we collect the turn-taking data using Parasocial Consensus Sampling (PCS) framework. Then we analyze the relationship between verbal and nonverbal features and turn-taking behaviors based on the consensus data and show how these features influence the time people use to take turns. Finally, we present a probabilistic multimodal end-of- turn prediction model, which enables virtual humans to make real-time turn-taking predictions. The result shows that our model achieves a higher accuracy than previous methods did.},

@article{kurtic_resources_2013,
	Abstract = {Overlapping talk occurs frequently in multi-party conversations, and is a domain in which speakers may pursue various communi- cative goals. The current study focuses on turn competition. Specifically, we seek to identify the phonetic differences that discriminate turn-competitive from non-competitive overlaps. Conversation analysis techniques were used to identify competitive and non-compet- itive overlaps in a corpus of multi-party recordings. We then generated a set of potentially predictive features relating to prosody (F0, intensity, speech rate, pausing) and overlap placement (overlap duration, point of overlap onset, recycling etc.). Decision tree clas- sifiers were trained on the features and tested on a classification task, in order to determine which features and feature combinations best differentiate competitive overlaps from non-competitive overlaps. It was found that overlap placement features played a greater role than prosodic features in indicating turn competition. Among the prosodic features tested, F0 and intensity were the most effective predictors of turn competition. Also, our decision tree models suggest that turn competitive and non-competitive overlaps can be initiated by a new speaker at many different points in the current speaker's turn. These findings have implications for the design of dialogue systems, and suggest novel hypotheses about how speakers deploy phonetic resources in everyday talk.},

	Abstract = {The article investigates a multimodal practice for self-selecting observed in a video-taped corpus of work meetings: the use of pointing gestures predicting possible turn completions and projecting the emergence of possible next speakers. This practice is analyzed in various sequential positions, namely at turn beginnings and at pre-beginnings. It displays recipients' practical online turn parsing, and their orientation to transition spaces, and to TCU, completions in a visible, recognizable, public way. It shows the emergent and progressive establishment of speakership, exploiting both systematic features of turn-taking and specific features of the interactional space. The article explores the emic, locally situated and contingent definition of speakership by considering not only where pointing gestures begin but
also where they end: pointing does not only end in pre-completion positions, projecting turn end, but can also persist through sequences, showing speaker's orientations to her turn's sequential implicativeness. Thus, by observing a particular multimodal practice within a specific interactional setting, the article explores participants' orientations to the rights and obligations associated with talk-related categories such as `non current speaker', `possible next speaker', `incipient speaker' and `current speaker'.},

We analyzed about 20 minutes of videotape of eight dialogues by four pairs of subjects performing a simple face-to-face cooperative laboratory task.We extend previous studies by explicating gaze patterns in face-to-face conversations, formalizing the most frequent pattern as a computational model of m-taking, and testing the model through an agent-based simulation. prior conversation simulations of conversational control acts relied on abstract speech-act representations of control.

	Abstract = {Mutual regulation during the naturalistic interaction of 150 mothers and their 4-month-old infants was investigated from a dynamic systems perspective. Microanalyses of a wide range of behaviors and analysis of contingencies indicated that a 3-s time period best captured contingencies. Both mothers and infants communicated primarily through vocal signals and responses, although maternal touches and infant looks also elicited responses. Although more expressive mothers did not have infants who behaved similarly, levels of contingent responsiveness between partners were significantly associated and oc- curred within distinct behavioral channels, suggesting coregulated interactional processes in which contingently responsive mothers shape their infants' communications toward mutual similarity. Mothers were more influential than infants over object play, whereas infants were more influential than mothers over expressive behavior. Interactional context consistently influenced contingent responsiveness; there was less mutual responsiveness when the infant was exploring, being held, or looking.},

	Abstract = {We describe the results of an experiment investigating whether an avatar's facial feedback can enhance turn-taking, undertaken as part of a usability study of a preliminary version of the COMIC multimodal dialogue system. The study focused on the phase of the interaction where the avatar embodies a virtual sales agent that guides the user through a range of possible tiling options for his or her newly redesigned bathroom. Our experiment employed a between-subjects design, where subjects used the system in one of two face conditions: (1) the ``expressive'' condition, where lip sync, blinking, facial expressions, gaze shifting and head turning were enabled; or (2) the ``zombie'' condition, where only lip sync was enabled. The results of the study were mixed, with some positive results on improving the interaction quality, but some unexpected negative results on task success and ease. On the positive side, the responses to our questionnaire indicated that the avatar's thinking expression helped to convey that the system was busy processing input---confirming Edlund and Nordstrand's (2002) finding---and that the facial expressions mitigated the system's perceived sluggishness in responding verbally. However, after examining the videos of the interactions, we concluded that the avatar's facial feedback---though helpful with some users---was unlikely to make up for the unnaturalness of the system's half-duplex interaction on its own, and thus should be used together with explicit signals such as busy cursors. We did also find that the subjects in the expressive condition looked back at the avatar significantly more often than those in the zombie condition---confirming the results of Sidner et al. (2004)---but it was unclear whether this had any impact on turn-taking. Interestingly, recent research by de Ruiter (2005) revealed no systematic relationship between other-gaze and turn-taking in human-human dialogues involving relevant external visual representations, so in retrospect the absence of any significant impact of the avatar's looking behaviour on turn-taking should perhaps be expected. With task success and ease, we were surprised to find that the subjects in the zombie condition scored significantly higher on several of our objective and perceived measures. One reason for the negative impact of the expressive face on task success and ease may have been that the expressive face distracted subjects from the task. Another possibility is that the expressive face raised users' expectations of the system's abilities, thereby encouraging subjects to use voice input rather than the mouse, which was generally a less successful strategy. We plan to investigate further with the final version of the system.},

More particularly, they have shown that participants mutually orient to the finely tuned multimodal details by which talk and action in interaction are sequentially organized. This article deals with this form of `participants' multimodal online analysis' by focusing on a particular phenomenon -- the methodical practices and resources by which the end of a turn and of an activity phase is projected and collectively achieved -- in a specific videorecorded setting -- a meeting in an architect's office. It aims at questioning both how these local orientations are systematically displayed and exploited by the participants for the sequential organization of their activity and how they can be demonstrably observed by the analyst.},

	Annote = {In natural conversation, the minimal gaps and overlaps of the turns at talk indicate an accurate regulation of the timings of the turn-taking system. Here we studied how the turn-taking affects the gaze of a non-involved viewer of a two-person conversation. The subjects were presented with a video of a conversation while their eye gaze was tracked with an infrared camera. As a control, the video was presented without sound and the sound with still image of the speakers. Turns at talk directed the gaze behaviour of the viewers; the gaze followed, rather than predicted, the speakership change around the turn transition. Both visual and auditory cues presented alone also induced gaze shifts towards the speaking person, although significantly less and later than when the cues of both modalities were available. These results show that the organization of turn-taking has a strong influence on the gaze patterns of even non-involved viewers of the conversation, and that visual and auditory cues are in part redundant in guiding the viewers' gaze.},

	Abstract = {Continuous interaction of mother and infant in the first weeks and months of an infant's life entrains the infant on many crucial aspects of how to do things together . Contingencies of gaze, vocalizations, and other movements are slowly routinized; this scaffolds directing of attention to each other and the world and gives to such multimodal interactions meaning. It is within these continuous interactions with caregivers that language emerges, starting from the first non- reflexive vocalizations that infants produce. The response that caregivers promptly give to these vocalizations informs infants of their relevance and helps shape them. We explored this systematicity by observing the coupling of infants' and mothers' vocalizations in unconstrained interactions longitudinally. While at three months, mothers seem to answer consistently to any speech related vocalization within the first two seconds, this pattern fades away at six and eight months. What remains stable across age is a structure in which overlapping vocalizations are rare and give way to a sequential pattern of vocal reciprocity --- an embryonic turn-taking behavior. Discussion relates this finding to early coordination in other modalities in an attempt to sketch a more holistic account of emerging co-action.},

	Abstract = {Learning is a social endeavor, in which the learner generally receives support from his/her social partner(s). In developmental research -- even though tutors/adults behavior modifications in their speech, gestures and motions have been extensively studied, studies barely consider the recipient's (i.e. the child's) perspective in the analysis of the adult's presentation, In addition, the variability in parental behavior, i.e. the fact that not every parent modifies her/his behavior in the same way, found less fine-grained analysis. In contrast, in this paper, we assume an interactional perspective investigating the loop between the tutor's and the learner's actions. With this approach, we aim both at discovering the levels and features of variability and at achieving a better understanding of how they come about within the course of the interaction. For our analysis, we used a combination of (1) qualitative investigation derived from ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis (CA), (2) semi-automatic computational 2D hand tracking and (3) a mathematically based visualization of the data. Our analysis reveals that tutors not only shape their demonstrations differently with regard to the intended recipient per se (adult-directed vs. child-directed), but most importantly that the learner's feedback during the presentation is consequential for the concrete ways in which the presentation is carried out.},

@article{yu_joint_2013,
	Abstract = {The coordination of visual attention among social partners is central to many components of human behavior and human development. Previous research has focused on one pathway to the coordination of looking behavior by social partners, gaze following. The extant evidence shows that even very young infants follow the direction of another's gaze but they do so only in highly constrained spatial contexts because gaze direction is not a spatially precise cue as to the visual target and not easily used in spatially complex social interactions. Our findings, derived from the moment-to-moment tracking of eye gaze of one-year-olds and their parents as they actively played with toys, provide evidence for an alternative pathway, through the coordination of hands and eyes in goal-directed action. In goal-directed actions, the hands and eyes of the actor are tightly coordinated both temporally and spatially, and thus, in contexts including manual engagement with objects, hand movements and eye movements provide redundant information about where the eyes are looking. Our findings show that one-year-olds rarely look to the parent's face and eyes in these contexts but rather infants and parents coordinate looking behavior without gaze following by attending to objects held by the self or the social partner. This pathway, through eye-hand coupling, leads to coordinated joint switches in visual attention and to an overall high rate of looking at the same object at the same time, and may be the dominant pathway through which physically active toddlers align their looking behavior with a social partner.},

	Abstract = {Eye gaze interaction can provide a convenient and natural addition to user-computer dialogues. We have previously reported on our interaction techniques using eye gaze [10]. While our techniques seemed useful in demonstration, we now investigate their strengths and weaknesses in a controlled setting. In this paper, we present two experiments that compare an interaction technique we developed for object selection based on a where a person is looking with the most commonly used selection method using a mouse. We find that our eye gaze interaction technique is faster than selection with a mouse. The results show that our algorithm, which makes use of knowledge about how the eyes behave, preserves the natural quickness of the eye. Eye gaze interaction is a reasonable addition to computer interaction and is convenient in situations where it is important to use the hands for other tasks. It is particularly beneficial for the larger screen workspaces and virtual environments of the future, and it will become increasingly practical as eye tracker technology matures.},

@article{bogels_planning_2018,
	Abstract = {Rapid response latencies in conversation suggest that responders start planning before the ongoing turn is fin- ished. Indeed, an earlier EEG study suggests that listeners start planning their responses to questions as soon as they can (B{\"o}gels et al., 2015a). The present study aimed to (1) replicate this early planning effect and (2) investigate whether such early response planning incurs a cost on participants' concurrent comprehension of the ongoing turn. During the experiment participants answered questions from a confederate partner. To address aim (1), the questions were designed such that response planning could start either early or late in the turn. Our results largely replicate B{\"o}gels et al. (2015a), showing a large positive ERP effect and an oscillatory alpha/beta reduction right after participants could have first started planning their verbal response, again suggesting an early start of response planning. To address aim (2), the confederate's questions also contained either an ex- pected word or an unexpected one to elicit a differential N400 effect, either before or after the start of response planning. We hypothesized an attenuated N400 effect after response planning had started. In contrast, the N400 effects before and after planning did not differ. There was, however, a positive correlation between participants' response time and their N400 effect size after planning had started; quick responders showed a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced attention to comprehension and possibly reduced anticipatory processing. We con- clude that early response planning can indeed impact comprehension processing.},

	Abstract = {Invoking turn-taking to explain conversations has long blocked progress in the field. Not only are there no logical or empirical grounds for saying conversation is constructed out of 'turns', but acoustic records show talk to be inseparable from how, in a micro- temporal dimension, individuals orchestrate their words. Conversations are dialogical activity irreducible to sequences of forms: phonetic substance matters.
Talking of 'turns' obscures the significance of how people act. By subordinating action to word-based patterns, talk comes to be conceptualized independently of timing. In advocating the contrary view that timing is central to talk, the paper highlights pitch matching. Using acoustic measures, persons are shown to orchestrate the pitch of their voices so that interindividual patterns embody the interpersonal sense of events. Obser- vations about timing thus clarify what listeners hear when utterances are spoken in a particular sense.},

We develop an algorithm mining sequential patterns made of itemsets with gap and linguistic constraints. The itemsets allow several kinds of information to be associated with one term. The advantage is the extraction of linguistic patterns with more expressiveness than the usual sequential patterns. In addition, the constraints enable to automatically prune irrelevant patterns. In order to manage the set of generated patterns, we propose a solution based on a partial ordering. A human user can thus easily validate them as relevant linguistic patterns. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach over two corpora coming from a newspaper.},

First, we show that mining sequential patterns of words with gap constraints gives new relevant linguistic patterns with respect to patterns built on n-grams. Then, we investigate how sequential patterns of itemsets can provide more generic linguistic patterns. We validate our approach from a linguistic point of view by conducting experiments on three corpora of various types of French texts (Poetry, Letters, and Fiction). By considering more particularly poetic texts, we show that characteristic linguistic patterns can be identified using data mining techniques.

@article{manrique_suspending_2015,
	Abstract = {Practices of other-initiated repair deal with problems of hearing or understanding what another person has said in the fast-moving turn-by-turn flow of conversation. As such, other-initiated repair plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of intersubjectivity in social interaction. This study finds and analyses a special type of other-initiated repair that is used in turn-by-turn conversation in a sign language: Argentine Sign Language (Lengua de Se{\~n}as Argentina or LSA). We describe a type of response termed a `freeze-look', which occurs when a person has just been asked a direct question: instead of answering the question in the next turn position, the person holds still while looking directly at the questioner. In these cases it is clear that the person is aware of having just been addressed and is not otherwise accounting for their delay in responding (e.g., by displaying a `thinking' face or hesitation, etc.). We find that this behavior functions as a way for an addressee to initiate repair by the person who asked the question. The `freeze-look' results in the questioner `re-doing' their action of asking a question, for example by repeating or rephrasing it. Thus we argue that the `freeze-look' is a practice for other-initiation of repair. In addition, we argue that it is an `off-record' practice, thus contrasting with known on-record practices such as saying `Huh?' or equivalents. The findings aim to contribute to research on human understanding in everyday turn-by-turn conversation by looking at an understudied sign language, with possible implications for our understanding of visual bodily communication in spoken languages as well.},

@article{girard-groeber_management_2015,
	Abstract = {There have been relatively few studies on sign language interaction carried out within the framework of conversation analysis (CA). Therefore, questions remain open about how the basic building blocks of social interaction such as turn, turn construction unit (TCU) and turn transition relevance place (TRP) can be understood and analysed in sign language interaction. 

Recent studies have shown that signers regularly fine-tune their turn-beginnings to potential completion points of turns (De Vos, Torreira & Levinson, 2015; Groeber, 2014; Groeber & Pochon-Berger, 2014). Moreover, signers deploy practices for overlap resolution as in spoken interaction (McCleary & Leite, 2013). While these studies have highlighted the signers' orientation to the `one-at-a-time' principle described by Sacks et al., (1974), the present article adds to this line of research by investigating in more detail those sequential environments where overlaps occur. The contribution provides an overview of different types of overlap with a focus of the overlap's onset with regard to a current signer's turn. 

On the basis of a 33-minute video-recording of a multi-party interaction between 4 female signers in Swiss German Sign Language (DSGS), the paper provides evidence for the orderliness of overlapping signing. Furthermore, the contribution demonstrates how participants collaborate in the situated construction of turns as a dynamic and emergent gestalt and how they interactionally achieve turn transition. Thereby the study adds to recent research in spoken and in signed interaction that proposes to rethink turn boundaries and turn transition as flexible and interactionally achieved.},

@article{devos_turn-timing_2015,
	Abstract = {In spoken interactions, interlocutors carefully plan and time their utterances, minimising gaps and overlaps between consecutive turns. Cross-linguistic comparison has indicated that spoken languages vary only minimally in terms of turn-timing, and language acquisition research has shown pre-linguistic vocal turn-taking in the first half year of life. These observations suggest that the turn-taking system may provide a fundamental basis for our linguistic capacities. The question remains however to what extent our capacity for rapid turn-taking is determined by modality constraints. The avoidance of overlapping turns could be motivated by the difficulty of hearing and speaking at the same time. If so, turn-taking in sign might show greater toleration for overlap. Alternatively, signed conversations may show a similar distribution of turn-timing as spoken languages, thus avoiding both gaps and overlaps. To address this question we look at turn-timing in question-answer sequences in spontaneous conversations of Sign Language of the Netherlands. The findings indicate that although there is considerable overlap in two or more signers' articulators in conversation, when proper allowance is made for onset preparation, post-utterance retraction and the intentional holding of signs for response, turn-taking latencies in sign look remarkably like those reported for spoken language. This is consistent with the possibility that, at least with regard to responses to questions, speakers and signers follow similar time courses in planning and producing their utterances in on-going conversation. This suggests that turn-taking systems may well be a shared cognitive infrastructure underlying all modern human languages, both spoken and signed.},

@article{gogate_study_2000,
	Abstract = {This study examined European American and Hispanic American mothers' multimodal communication to their infants (N 􏰆 24). The infants were from three age groups representing three levels of lexical-mapping de- velopment: prelexical (5 to 8 months), early-lexical (9 to 17 months), and advanced-lexical (21 to 30 months). Mothers taught their infants four target (novel) words by using distinct objects during a semistructured play episode. Recent research suggests that young infants rely on temporal synchrony to learn syllable--object rela- tions, but later, the role of synchrony diminishes. Thus, mothers' target and nontarget naming were coded for synchrony and other communication styles. The results indicated that mothers used target words more often than nontarget words in synchrony with object motion and sometimes touch. Thus, ``multimodal motherese'' likely highlights target word-referent relations for infants. Further, mothers tailored their communication to in- fants' level of lexical-mapping development. Mothers of prelexical infants used target words in synchrony with object motion more often than mothers of early- and advanced-lexical infants. Mothers' decreasing use of synchrony across age parallels infants' decreasing reliance on synchrony, suggesting a dynamical and recipro- cal environment--organismic relation.},

	Abstract = {We conducted a naturalistic study in which German mothers interacted with their three-month-old infants during diaper changing as an everyday activity. Following the idea that \#x201C;acoustic packaging \#x201D; educates infants' attention, we explored whether the verbal input to the infants in natural interactions simultaneously contains action information. Applying a microanalysis method, we first analyzed the data qualitatively by identifying classes of body movement and vocal activities (that we called vocal types). We used these categories to observe the multimodal interaction practices of mothers and to describe the interaction ecology of everyday activity. Second, we analyzed the co-occurrence of language (in the form of different vocal activities) and action (in the form of body movements) quantitatively. We found that during early interaction with infants, German mothers vocalize in a tight temporal relationship with action over a considerable part of the overall interaction time, thereby making the vocal signal both perceivable and tangible to the infants.},

@article{levinson_turn-taking_2016,
	Abstract = {Most language usage is interactive, involving rapid turn-taking. The turn-taking system has a number of striking properties: turns are short and responses are remarkably rapid, but turns are of varying length and often of very complex construction such that the underlying cognitive processing is highly compressed. Although neglected in cognitive science, the system has deep implications for language processing and acquisition that are only now becoming clear. Appearing earlier in ontogeny than linguistic competence, it is also found across all the major primate clades. This suggests a possible phylogenetic continuity, which may provide key insights into language evolution.},

@article{abu-zhaya_multimodal_2017,
	Abstract = {Both touch and speech independently have been shown to play an important role in infant development. However, little is known about how they may be combined in the input to the child. We examined the use of touch and speech together by having mothers read their 5-month-olds books about body parts and animals. Results suggest that speech+touch multimodal events are characterized by more exaggerated touch and speech cues. Further, our results suggest that maternal touches are aligned with speech and that mothers tend to touch their infants in locations that are congruent with names of body parts. Thus, our results suggest that tactile cues could potentially aid both infant word segmentation and word learning.},

	Abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you'll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you're working with--business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances--this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it.   You'll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world's most talented designers and visual journalists, including Cond{\'e} Nast Traveler's John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine's Fernando Baptista, The New York Times' Steve Duenes, The Washington Post's Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford's Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world's leading designers.  The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals:  * Why data visualization should be thought of as ``functional art'' rather than fine art * How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking  * The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ * Best practices for creating interactive information graphics * A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ * An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world's top designers and visual artists  On the DVD-ROM: In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You'll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition. You will find a link in the last few pages of your eBook that directs you to the media files.  Helpful tips: If you are able to search the book, search for "Where are the lesson files?"  Go to the very last page of the book and scroll backwards. You will need a web-enabled device or computer in order to access the media files that accompany this ebook. Entering the URL supplied into a computer with web access will allow you to get to the files. Depending on your device, it is possible that your display settings will cut off part of the URL. To make sure this is not the case, try reducing your font size and turning your device to a landscape view. This should cause the full URL to appear.},

	Abstract = {Young children answer questions with longer delays than adults do, and they don't reach typical adult response times until several years later. We hypothesized that this prolonged pattern of delay in children's timing results from competing demands: to give an answer, children must understand a question while simultaneously planning and initiating their response. Even as children get older and more efficient in this process, the demands on them increase because their verbal responses become more complex. We analyzed conversational question--answer sequences between caregivers and their children from ages 1;8 to 3;5, finding that children (1) initiate simple answers more quickly than complex ones, (2) initiate simple answers quickly from an early age, and (3) initiate complex answers more quickly as they grow older. Our results suggest that children aim to respond quickly from the start, improving on earlier-acquired answer types while they begin to practice later-acquired, slower ones.},

Reaction- time was assessed by a software package. All visual reaction times were longer in women than in men. In the eye-dominant hand and the left eye--left hand visual reaction times, the left-handers had a superiority over the right handers, but there was no difference between the right eye-right hand visual reaction times of the right- and left-handers. In right-handers, all visual reaction times were longer in women than in men, but there was no sex difference in left-handers. The results suggest that left-handed players have probably an intrinsic neurological advantage.},

@article{freud_turn-taking_2016,
	Abstract = {Stuttering is a disorder that affects not only the speaker, but also the conversational partner (CP). This study was designed to examine whether people communicate differently with adults-who-stutter (AWS), compared to adults-who-do-not-stutter (AWNS). Specifically, we examined the occurrence of three basic and common turn-taking behaviors (TTBs) used by CPs, during interactions with AWS compared to AWNS. Ten adults (age range 20--32), na{\"\i}ve to the purposes of this study, were recorded during a conversation with four speakers: two AWS and two AWNS. Consequently, a total of 40 conversations were analyzed. Based on transcriptions of these interactions, the relative frequency of the three TTBs (Reinforcers, Interruptions and Completions) was calculated. The ten CPs exhibited a similar proportion of TTBs during their conversations with the AWS and AWNS (p {\textgreater} 0.05). However, during their conversations with the AWS, the CPs exhibited a higher proportion of Interruptions and Completions in response to stuttered turns, compared to fluent turns (p {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, the ten CPs exhibited a larger proportion of Reinforcers during their conversations with the AWS with moderate stuttering severity, compared to the AWS with mild severity (p = 0.04). Results provide a preliminary insight to CPs' communication behavior in the presence of stuttering. Results are interpreted as demonstrating that, within this context, CPs do not exhibit different turn-taking behaviors when conversing with AWS and AWNS. However, CPs exhibit different TTBs in association with stuttered speech, compared to fluent speech of PWS.},

@article{hilbrink_early_2015,
	Abstract = {To accomplish a smooth transition in conversation from one speaker to the next, a tight coordination of interaction between speakers is required. Recent studies of adult conversation suggest that this close timing of interaction may well be a universal feature of conversation. In the present paper, we set out to assess the development of this close timing of turns in infancy in vocal exchanges between mothers and infants. Previous research has demonstrated an early sensitivity to timing in interactions (e.g. Murray \& Trevarthen, 1985). In contrast, less is known about infants' abilities to produce turns in a timely manner and existing findings are rather patchy. We conducted a longitudinal study of twelve mother-infant dyads in free-play interactions at the ages of 3, 4, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months. Based on existing work and the predictions made by the Interaction Engine Hypothesis (Levinson, 2006), we expected that infants would begin to develop the temporal properties of turn-taking early in infancy but that their timing of turns would slow down at 12 months, which is around the time when infants start to produce their first words. Findings were consistent with our predictions: Infants were relatively fast at timing their turn early in infancy but slowed down towards the end of the first year. Furthermore, the changes observed in infants' turn-timing skills were not caused by changes in maternal timing, which remained stable across the 3-18 month period. However, the slowing down of turn-timing started somewhat earlier than predicted: at 9 months.},

@article{gratier_early_2015,
	Abstract = {Infants are known to engage in conversation-like exchanges from the end of the second month after birth. These `protoconversations' involve both turn-taking and overlapping vocalization. Previous research has shown that the temporal organization of adult-infant turn-taking sequences is similar to that of adult verbal conversation. It has also been shown that young infants adjust the quality of their vocalization in response to the quality and timing of adult vocalization. We present new evidence of turn-taking interaction in infants aged between 8 and 21 weeks based on the analysis of 176 samples of naturalistic face-to-face interactions from 51 dyads. We found high levels of latched turns as well as frequent initiation of turn-taking by infants at these ages. Our data do not support the hypothesis that turn-taking ability increases with age between 2 and 5 months but do suggest that infants are active participants in turn-taking from the earliest age and that mothers adjust turn-taking formats to infants.},

Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendous progress has been made, ranging from efficient and scalable algorithms for frequent itemset mining in transaction databases to numerous research frontiers, such as sequential pattern mining, structured pattern mining, correlation mining, associative classification, and frequent pattern-based clustering, as well as their broad applications. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the current status of frequent pattern mining and discuss a few promising research directions. We believe that frequent pattern mining research has substantially broadened the scope of data analysis and will have deep impact on data mining methodologies and applications in the long run. However, there are still some challenging research issues that need to be solved before frequent pattern mining can claim a cornerstone approach in data mining applications.},

	Abstract = {The analytical methods of information theory are applied to the data obtained in certain choice-reaction-time experiments. Two types of experiment were performed: (a) a conventional choice-reaction experiment, with various numbers of alternatives up to ten, and with a negligible proportion of errors, and (b) a ten-choice experiment in which the subjects deliberately reduced their reaction time by allowing themselves various proportions of errors. The principal finding is that the rate of gain of information is, on the average, constant with respect to time, within the duration of one perceptual-motor act, and has a value of the order of five ``bits'' per second. The distribution of reaction times among the ten stimuli in the second experiment is shown to be related to the objective uncertainty as to which response will be given to each stimulus. The distribution of reaction times among the responses is also related to the same uncertainty. This is further evidence that information is intimately concerned with reaction time. Some possible conceptual models of the process are considered, but tests against the data are inconclusive.},

	Abstract = {Objective Reaction time (RT) to sound is known to be related to loudness in adult listeners. The purpose of this study was to determine whether infants' RT to sound decreases systematically with intensity as it does in adults.
        Design RT was measured for 24 6- to 9-mo-old infants and 11 19- to 26-yr-old adults. All participants were normal hearing, na{\"\i}ve listeners. The stimuli consisted of 4000 and 1000 Hz pure tones presented to the right ear through an insert earphone. Stimulus intensities ranged in 10 dB steps from 40 to 80 dB SPL for adults and 50 to 90 dB SPL for infants. Infant responses consisted of a head turn toward a reinforcer whereas adults responded by raising their hand. An additional three adults responded with a head turn. RT was defined as the time between the onset of the tone and an observer's button press indicating that a response had occurred. RT was corrected for the observer's reaction time and averaged over three to five repetitions at each level to obtain the mean reaction time (MRT) for each subject, frequency, and level.
        Results MRT decreased with increasing intensity in both infants and adults. An examination of the MRT-intensity functions suggests that the infant functions may be steeper than those of adults, although considerable variability exists between listeners.
        Conclusions RT holds potential as a measure of loudness in infants. Whether differences in the MRT-intensity slopes exist between infants and adults is unclear. Future investigations using methods to reduce the variability of RT measurements are needed to examine potential slope differences further.},

@article{stivers_universals_2009,
	Abstract = {Informal verbal interaction is the core matrix for human social life. A mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of interaction is a system of turn-taking that regulates who is to speak and when. Yet relatively little is known about how this system varies across cultures. The anthropological literature reports significant cultural differences in the timing of turn-taking in ordinary conversation. We test these claims and show that in fact there are striking universals in the underlying pattern of response latency in conversation. Using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from traditional indigenous communities to major world languages, we show that all of the languages tested provide clear evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a minimization of silence between conversational turns. In addition, all of the languages show the same factors explaining within-language variation in speed of response. We do, however, find differences across the languages in the average gap between turns, within a range of 250 ms from the cross-language mean. We believe that a natural sensitivity to these tempo differences leads to a subjective perception of dramatic or even fundamental differences as offered in ethnographic reports of conversational style. Our empirical evidence suggests robust human universals in this domain, where local variations are quantitative only, pointing to a single shared infrastructure for language use with likely ethological foundations.},

The increased use of these tools in gesture, sign language and multimodal interaction studies has led to stronger requirements on the flexibility, the efficiency and in particular the time accuracy of annotation tools. This paper describes the efforts made to make ELAN a tool that meets these requirements, with special attention to the developments in the area of time accuracy.

As a result, there are few studies of mechanisms underlying developmental changes in prelinguistic vocal production. Here we report the first evidence that caregivers'speech to babbling infants provides crucial, real-time guidance to the development of prelinguistic vocalizations. Mothers of 9.5-month-old infants were instructed to provide models of vocal production timed to be either contingent or noncontingent on their infants' babbling. Infants given contingent feedback rapidly restructured their babbling, incorporating phonological patterns from caregivers'speech, but infants given noncontingent feedback did not. The new vocalizations of the infants in the contingent condition shared phonological form but not phonetic content with their mothers' speech. Thus, prelinguistic infants learned new vocal forms by discovering phonological patterns in their mothers' contingent speech and then generalizing from these patterns., Infants' prelinguistic vocalizations are rarely considered relevant for communicative development.

	Abstract = {In conversation, turn transitions between speakers often occur smoothly, usually within a time window of a few hundred milliseconds. It has been argued, on the basis of a button-press experiment [De Ruiter, J. P., Mitterer, H., \& Enfield, N. J. (2006). Projecting the end of a speaker's turn: A cognitive cornerstone of conversation. Language, 82(3):515--535], that participants in conversation rely mainly on lexico-syntactic information when timing and producing their turns, and that they do not need to make use of intonational cues to achieve smooth transitions and avoid overlaps. In contrast to this view, but in line with previous observational studies, our results from a dialogue task and a button-press task involving questions and answers indicate that the identification of the end of intonational phrases is necessary for smooth turn-taking. In both tasks, participants never responded to questions (i.e., gave an answer or pressed a button to indicate a turn end) at turn-internal points of syntactic completion in the absence of an intonational phrase boundary. Moreover, in the button-press task, they often pressed the button at the same point of syntactic completion when the final word of an intonational phrase was cross-spliced at that location. Furthermore, truncated stimuli ending in a syntactic completion point but lacking an intonational phrase boundary led to significantly delayed button presses. In light of these results, we argue that earlier claims that intonation is not necessary for correct turn-end projection are misguided, and that research on turn-taking should continue to consider intonation as a source of turn-end cues along with other linguistic and communicative phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the biological foundations of language is vital to gaining insight into how the capacity for language may have evolved in humans. Animal models can be exploited to learn about the biological underpinnings of shared human traits, and although no other animals display speech or language, a range of behaviors found throughout the animal kingdom are relevant to speech and spoken language. To date, such investigations have been dominated by studies of our closest primate relatives searching for shared traits, or more distantly related species that are sophisticated vocal communicators, like songbirds. Herein I make the case for turning our attention to the Chiropterans, to shed new light on the biological encoding and evolution of human language-relevant traits. Bats employ complex vocalizations to facilitate navigation as well as social interactions, and are exquisitely tuned to acoustic information. Furthermore, bats display behaviors such as vocal learning and vocal turn-taking that are directly pertinent for human spoken language. Emerging technologies are now allowing the study of bat vocal communication, from the behavioral to the neurobiological and molecular level. Although it is clear that no single animal model can reflect the complexity of human language, by comparing such findings across diverse species we can identify the shared biological mechanisms likely to have influenced the evolution of human language.},

@article{kingsolver_aerodynamics_1985,
	Abstract = {We examine several aerodynamic and thermoregulatory hypotheses about possible adaptive factors in the evolution of wings from small winglets in insects. Using physical models of Paleozoic insects in a wind tunnel, we explore the potential effects of wings for increasing gliding distance, increasing dispersal distance during parachuting, improving attitude control or stability, and elevating body temperatures during thermoregulation. The effects of body size and shape, wing length, number, and venation, and meteorological conditions are considered. Hypotheses consistent with both fixed and moveable wing articulations are examined. Short wings have no significant effects on any of the aerodynamic characteristics, relative to wingless models, while large wings do have significant effects. In contrast, short wings have large thermoregulatory effects relative to wingless models, but further increases in wing length do not significantly affect thermoregulatory performance. At any body size, there is a wing length below which there are significant thermoregulatory effects of increasing wing length, and above which there are significant aerodynamic effects of increasing wing length. The relative wing length at which this transition occurs decreases with increasing body size. These results suggest that there could be no effective selection for increasing wing length in wingless or short-winged insects in relation to increased aerodynamic capacity. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that insect wings initially served a thermoregulatory function and were used for aerodynamic functions only at larger wing lengths and/or body sizes. Thus, we propose that thermoregulation was the primary adaptive factor in the early evolution of wings that preadapted them for the subsequent evolution of flight. Our results illustrate an evolutionary mechanism in which a purely isometric change in body size may produce a qualitative change in the function of a given structure.

	Abstract = {This paper describes a recently completed common resource for the study of spoken discourse, the NXT-format Switchboard Corpus. Switchboard is a long-standing corpus of telephone conversations (Godfrey et al. in SWITCHBOARD: Telephone speech corpus for research and development. In Proceedings of ICASSP-92, pp. 517--520, 1992). We have brought together transcriptions with existing annotations for syntax, disfluency, speech acts, animacy, information status, coreference, and prosody; along with substantial new annotations of focus/contrast, more prosody, syllables and phones. The combined corpus uses the format of the NITE XML Toolkit, which allows these annotations to be browsed and searched as a coherent set (Carletta et al. in Lang Resour Eval J 39(4):313--334, 2005). The resulting corpus is a rich resource for the investigation of the linguistic features of dialogue and how they interact. As well as describing the corpus itself, we discuss our approach to overcoming issues involved in such a data integration project, relevant to both users of the corpus and others in the language resource community undertaking similar projects.},

In addition to the spatial overlap of activated regions, we also analyzed the available data on the time course of activations. The analysis specified regions and time windows of activation for the core processes of word production: lexical selection, phonological code retrieval, syllabification, and phonetic/articulatory preparation. A comparison of the word production results with studies on auditory word/non-word perception and reading showed that the time course of activations in word production is, on the whole, compatible with the temporal constraints that perception processes impose on the production processes they affect in picture/word interference paradigms.},

@article{indefrey_spatial_2011,
	Abstract = {In the first decade of neurocognitive word production research the predominant approach was brain mapping, i.e. investigating the regional cerebral brain activation patterns correlated with word production tasks, such as picture naming and word generation. Indefrey and Levelt (2004) conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of word production studies that used this approach and combined the resulting spatial information on neural correlates of component processes of word production with information on the time course of word production provided by behavioral and electromagnetic studies. In recent years, neurocognitive word production research has seen a major change towards a hypothesis testing approach. This approach is characterized by the design of experimental variables modulating single component processes of word production and testing for predicted effects on spatial or temporal neurocognitive signatures of these components. This change was accompanied by the development of a broader spectrum of measurement and analysis techniques. The article reviews the findings of recent studies using the new approach. The time course assumptions of Indefrey and Levelt (2004) have largely been confirmed requiring only minor adaptations. Adaptations of the brain structure/function relationships proposed by Indefrey and Levelt (2004) include the precise role of subregions of the left inferior frontal gyrus as well as a probable, yet to date unclear role of the inferior parietal cortex in word production.},

@book{berwick_why_2016,
	Abstract = {Berwick and Chomsky draw on recent developments in linguistic theory to offer an evolutionary account of language and humans' remarkable, species-specific ability to acquire it.``A loosely connected collection of four essays that will fascinate anyone interested in the extraordinary phenomenon of language.''---New York Review of BooksWe are born crying, but those cries signal the first stirring of language. Within a year or so, infants master the sound system of their language; a few years after that, they are engaging in conversations. This remarkable, species-specific ability to acquire any human language---``the language faculty''---raises important biological questions about language, including how it has evolved. This book by two distinguished scholars---a computer scientist and a linguist---addresses the enduring question of the evolution of language.Robert Berwick and Noam Chomsky explain that until recently the evolutionary question could not be properly posed, because we did not have a clear idea of how to define ``language'' and therefore what it was that had evolved. But since the Minimalist Program, developed by Chomsky and others, we know the key ingredients of language and can put together an account of the evolution of human language and what distinguishes us from all other animals.Berwick and Chomsky discuss the biolinguistic perspective on language, which views language as a particular object of the biological world; the computational efficiency of language as a system of thought and understanding; the tension between Darwin's idea of gradual change and our contemporary understanding about evolutionary change and language; and evidence from nonhuman animals, in particular vocal learning in songbirds.},

@book{gillespie_population_2010,
	Abstract = {This concise introduction offers students and researchers an overview of the discipline that connects genetics and evolution. Addressing the theories behind population genetics and relevant empirical evidence, John Gillespie discusses genetic drift, natural selection, nonrandom mating, quantitative genetics, and the evolutionary advantage of sex. First published to wide acclaim in 1998, this brilliant primer has been updated to include new sections on molecular evolution, genetic drift, genetic load, the stationary distribution, and two-locus dynamics. This book is indispensable for students working in a laboratory setting or studying free-ranging populations.},
