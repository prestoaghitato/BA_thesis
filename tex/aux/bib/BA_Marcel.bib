	abstract = {We conducted a naturalistic study in which German mothers interacted with their three-month-old infants during diaper changing as an everyday activity. Following the idea that \#x201C;acoustic packaging \#x201D; educates infants' attention, we explored whether the verbal input to the infants in natural interactions simultaneously contains action information. Applying a microanalysis method, we first analyzed the data qualitatively by identifying classes of body movement and vocal activities (that we called vocal types). We used these categories to observe the multimodal interaction practices of mothers and to describe the interaction ecology of everyday activity. Second, we analyzed the co-occurrence of language (in the form of different vocal activities) and action (in the form of body movements) quantitatively. We found that during early interaction with infants, German mothers vocalize in a tight temporal relationship with action over a considerable part of the overall interaction time, thereby making the vocal signal both perceivable and tangible to the infants.},

Appearing earlier in ontogeny than linguistic competence, it is also found across all the major primate clades.

Results suggest that speech+touch multimodal events are characterized by more exaggerated touch and speech cues.

	abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you’ll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you’re working with–business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances–this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it.   You’ll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world’s most talented designers and visual journalists, including Condé Nast Traveler’s John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine’s Fernando Baptista, The New York Times’ Steve Duenes, The Washington Post’s Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford’s Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world’s leading designers.  The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals:  • Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art • How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking  • The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ • Best practices for creating interactive information graphics • A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ • An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world’s top designers and visual artists  On the DVD-ROM: In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You’ll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition.

We hypothesized that this prolonged pattern of delay in children's timing results from competing demands: to give an answer, children must understand a question while simultaneously planning and initiating their response. Even as children get older and more efficient in this process, the demands on them increase because their verbal responses become more complex. We analyzed conversational question–answer sequences between caregivers and their children from ages 1;8 to 3;5, finding that children (1) initiate simple answers more quickly than complex ones, (2) initiate simple answers quickly from an early age, and (3) initiate complex answers more quickly as they grow older. Our results suggest that children aim to respond quickly from the start, improving on earlier-acquired answer types while they begin to practice later-acquired, slower ones.},

This study was designed to examine whether people communicate differently with adults-who-stutter (AWS), compared to adults-who-do-not-stutter (AWNS). Specifically, we examined the occurrence of three basic and common turn-taking behaviors (TTBs) used by CPs, during interactions with AWS compared to AWNS. Ten adults (age range 20–32), naïve to the purposes of this study, were recorded during a conversation with four speakers: two AWS and two AWNS. Consequently, a total of 40 conversations were analyzed. Based on transcriptions of these interactions, the relative frequency of the three TTBs (Reinforcers, Interruptions and Completions) was calculated. The ten CPs exhibited a similar proportion of TTBs during their conversations with the AWS and AWNS (p {\textgreater} 0.05). However, during their conversations with the AWS, the CPs exhibited a higher proportion of Interruptions and Completions in response to stuttered turns, compared to fluent turns (p {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, the ten CPs exhibited a larger proportion of Reinforcers during their conversations with the AWS with moderate stuttering severity, compared to the AWS with mild severity (p = 0.04). Results provide a preliminary insight to CPs’ communication behavior in the presence of stuttering. Results are interpreted as demonstrating that, within this context, CPs do not exhibit different turn-taking behaviors when conversing with AWS and AWNS. However, CPs exhibit different TTBs in association with stuttered speech, compared to fluent speech of PWS.},

	abstract = {To accomplish a smooth transition in conversation from one speaker to the next, a tight coordination of interaction between speakers is required. Recent studies of adult conversation suggest that this close timing of interaction may well be a universal feature of conversation. In the present paper, we set out to assess the development of this close timing of turns in infancy in vocal exchanges between mothers and infants. Previous research has demonstrated an early sensitivity to timing in interactions (e.g. Murray \& Trevarthen, 1985). In contrast, less is known about infants’ abilities to produce turns in a timely manner and existing findings are rather patchy. We conducted a longitudinal study of twelve mother-infant dyads in free-play interactions at the ages of 3, 4, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months. Based on existing work and the predictions made by the Interaction Engine Hypothesis (Levinson, 2006), we expected that infants would begin to develop the temporal properties of turn-taking early in infancy but that their timing of turns would slow down at 12 months, which is around the time when infants start to produce their first words. Findings were consistent with our predictions: Infants were relatively fast at timing their turn early in infancy but slowed down towards the end of the first year. Furthermore, the changes observed in infants’ turn-timing skills were not caused by changes in maternal timing, which remained stable across the 3-18 month period. However, the slowing down of turn-timing started somewhat earlier than predicted: at 9 months.},

Previous research has shown that the temporal organization of adult-infant turn-taking sequences is similar to that of adult verbal conversation. It has also been shown that young infants adjust the quality of their vocalization in response to the quality and timing of adult vocalization. We present new evidence of turn-taking interaction in infants aged between 8 and 21 weeks based on the analysis of 176 samples of naturalistic face-to-face interactions from 51 dyads. We found high levels of latched turns as well as frequent initiation of turn-taking by infants at these ages. Our data do not support the hypothesis that turn-taking ability increases with age between 2 and 5 months but do suggest that infants are active participants in turn-taking from the earliest age and that mothers adjust turn-taking formats to infants.},

	abstract = {The analytical methods of information theory are applied to the data obtained in certain choice-reaction-time experiments. Two types of experiment were performed: (a) a conventional choice-reaction experiment, with various numbers of alternatives up to ten, and with a negligible proportion of errors, and (b) a ten-choice experiment in which the subjects deliberately reduced their reaction time by allowing themselves various proportions of errors. The principal finding is that the rate of gain of information is, on the average, constant with respect to time, within the duration of one perceptual-motor act, and has a value of the order of five “bits” per second. The distribution of reaction times among the ten stimuli in the second experiment is shown to be related to the objective uncertainty as to which response will be given to each stimulus. The distribution of reaction times among the responses is also related to the same uncertainty. This is further evidence that information is intimately concerned with reaction time. Some possible conceptual models of the process are considered, but tests against the data are inconclusive.},

	abstract = {Objective Reaction time (RT) to sound is known to be related to loudness in adult listeners. The purpose of this study was to determine whether infants’ RT to sound decreases systematically with intensity as it does in adults.
        Design RT was measured for 24 6- to 9-mo-old infants and 11 19- to 26-yr-old adults. All participants were normal hearing, naïve listeners. The stimuli consisted of 4000 and 1000 Hz pure tones presented to the right ear through an insert earphone. Stimulus intensities ranged in 10 dB steps from 40 to 80 dB SPL for adults and 50 to 90 dB SPL for infants. Infant responses consisted of a head turn toward a reinforcer whereas adults responded by raising their hand. An additional three adults responded with a head turn. RT was defined as the time between the onset of the tone and an observer’s button press indicating that a response had occurred. RT was corrected for the observer’s reaction time and averaged over three to five repetitions at each level to obtain the mean reaction time (MRT) for each subject, frequency, and level.
        Results MRT decreased with increasing intensity in both infants and adults. An examination of the MRT-intensity functions suggests that the infant functions may be steeper than those of adults, although considerable variability exists between listeners.
        Conclusions RT holds potential as a measure of loudness in infants. Whether differences in the MRT-intensity slopes exist between infants and adults is unclear. Future investigations using methods to reduce the variability of RT measurements are needed to examine potential slope differences further.},

	abstract = {Informal verbal interaction is the core matrix for human social life. A mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of interaction is a system of turn-taking that regulates who is to speak and when. Yet relatively little is known about how this system varies across cultures. The anthropological literature reports significant cultural differences in the timing of turn-taking in ordinary conversation. We test these claims and show that in fact there are striking universals in the underlying pattern of response latency in conversation. Using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from traditional indigenous communities to major world languages, we show that all of the languages tested provide clear evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a minimization of silence between conversational turns. In addition, all of the languages show the same factors explaining within-language variation in speed of response. We do, however, find differences across the languages in the average gap between turns, within a range of 250 ms from the cross-language mean. We believe that a natural sensitivity to these tempo differences leads to a subjective perception of dramatic or even fundamental differences as offered in ethnographic reports of conversational style. Our empirical evidence suggests robust human universals in this domain, where local variations are quantitative only, pointing to a single shared infrastructure for language use with likely ethological foundations.},

	abstract = {In conversation, turn transitions between speakers often occur smoothly, usually within a time window of a few hundred milliseconds. It has been argued, on the basis of a button-press experiment [De Ruiter, J. P., Mitterer, H., \& Enfield, N. J. (2006). Projecting the end of a speaker's turn: A cognitive cornerstone of conversation. Language, 82(3):515–535], that participants in conversation rely mainly on lexico-syntactic information when timing and producing their turns, and that they do not need to make use of intonational cues to achieve smooth transitions and avoid overlaps. In contrast to this view, but in line with previous observational studies, our results from a dialogue task and a button-press task involving questions and answers indicate that the identification of the end of intonational phrases is necessary for smooth turn-taking. In both tasks, participants never responded to questions (i.e., gave an answer or pressed a button to indicate a turn end) at turn-internal points of syntactic completion in the absence of an intonational phrase boundary. Moreover, in the button-press task, they often pressed the button at the same point of syntactic completion when the final word of an intonational phrase was cross-spliced at that location. Furthermore, truncated stimuli ending in a syntactic completion point but lacking an intonational phrase boundary led to significantly delayed button presses. In light of these results, we argue that earlier claims that intonation is not necessary for correct turn-end projection are misguided, and that research on turn-taking should continue to consider intonation as a source of turn-end cues along with other linguistic and communicative phenomena.},
